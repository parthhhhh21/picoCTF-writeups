### Approach :

Downloaded the file given in the question and uploaded the same to an hex editor online website :

came to know that this is .pb file so, thought of converting this file to a png file so, that I can view the file easily. So, downloaded a png image online and compared it with the file given. Had to make some alterations in the hex format so, that the .pb file can be converted to a png file :

downloaded the new created png file :

opened it with paint and all I had to do was remove the red background behind which the flag was hidden :
