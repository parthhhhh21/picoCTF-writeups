## Scavenger Hunt

### Approach :

Launched the inspector and found out that two parts of the flag were given there itself :

Part1 :

Part2 :

Something I found written at the end which said "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?". So, i googled what this actually is and found this :

so, this simply tells us to use "robots.txt" and thus gave me the next part of the flag and also, the clue for the next part :

Part3 :

it said something about " apache server ". So, further looked into it :

this tells us to use ".htaccess" to get the next part of the flag along with the clue for the next part : 

Part4 :

it said something about " storing information on websites on mac" so, looked into it :

this tells us to use ".DS_Store" to get the next and final part of the flag :

Part5 :
