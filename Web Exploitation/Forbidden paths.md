## Forbidden paths 
### Approach :
•	It is  given we can’t use absolute file paths.

•	But the path to the flag is given in the question.

•	Therefore we must access each directory separately as it is given in the question.

•	The command to access parent directories of the
cwd is ../

•	Its given that we have to climb up 4 directories to
get to the flag.

The following command is given in the text box:
